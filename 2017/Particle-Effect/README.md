Created by Kaspar So
GitHub: /KasparIsSo

Made with Processing, a coding environment built on top of Java

Run particleEffect.pde to run see the core of the program. 

Particle.pde is a particle class. (controls particle behavior)


Instructions:

If running through Processing:

Make sure you have installed the controlP5 library, it is required for the UI.
Images are saved in a "screenshots" folder in the same parent folder as the sketch, which in this case would be "particleEffect".
As with any Processing sketch, the parent folder of the sketch must be named the same as the sketch. If you change the folder name, change the sketch name as well.
Works on Processing 3.2.3 (last tested)



Caution:

Be careful with maximizing T Allowance as it requires more rendering power.
